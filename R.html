        Every culture has looked up at the stars and seen stories—maps of meaning drawn across the darkness. The Greeks imagined Orion as a mighty hunter, proud and bold, roaming the heavens with his faithful dogs. In contrast, Polynesians saw the same group of stars as a celestial canoe, sailing through the night and guiding wayfarers across the Pacific. These cultural differences are not contradictions—they are reflections of each society’s connection to nature, survival, and belief.

      <p>
        From China's celestial dragons to the emu-shaped constellations of Aboriginal Australia, the stars have served as a storytelling canvas for millennia. These luminous patterns etched into the night sky hold the myths, morals, and mysteries of countless civilizations.
        In Chinese tradition, the sky is divided into four quadrants, each ruled by a mythical beast—the Azure Dragon of the East, the White Tiger of the West, the Black Tortoise of the North, and the Vermilion Bird of the South. These symbolic guardians weren’t just myth; they formed a cosmic order that influenced calendars, agriculture, and imperial decisions.
